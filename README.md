Bonfire is open source decorators utils for angular.

- Make change detection easy
- Makes Observable for you

You can make your code cleaner and simpler with adding just 2 decorators to your code.
We know that angular change detection is not simple if you want it to be officiant. So I made Bonfire.
Simple solution to hard problem.

_Now there is no use to call the change detection!_

## Installation

Bonfire requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

```sh
$ npm i @intelligo.ai/bonfire
```


## The Tools
See Examples Below:

| Tools | What it does?  | How to use?  |
| :-----: | :-: | :-: |
| (1) ReRenderOnChange | The decorator on the component is actually what causes the other decorators to use change detection | Put it on the top of the component and make sure the component have change detection injected |
| (2) SetChecker | Put it on a property we want to trigger re-render ***only*** if it changed | Just put it on the property |
| (3) WithObservable | Generate a behavior subject (Observable), Which emit values that stored in the original property (You don't need to maintain it at all! Just use it) | Put in on the original property and next to it write the same property name with '$', it will store automatically |


## Where to use

_Before you use it, make sure you inject the change detection to your component!_

```typescript
import { ReRenderOnChange, SetChecker, WithObservable } from '@intelligo.ai/bonfire';

@ReRenderOnChange() // <== (1)
@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.scss'],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush // <== IMPORTANT
})

export class MyComponent {

  @SetChecker() group: ISomeInterface = {
   test: [
     {
       name: 'Hello',
       age: 30
     }
    ]
  }; // <== (2)

  @WithObservable() showLoader = false; showLoader$: BehaviorSubject<boolean>; // <== (3)

  constructor(
    private cd: ChangeDetectorRef // <== MOST IMPORTANT
  ) {

    setTimeout(() => {
      // This won't trigger change detection unless you are using SetChecker :-)
      this.groups.test[0].name = 'World'
    },5000)

  }
}
```

### Dependencies

Bonfire uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.
- [Rxjs](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) - Reactive extensions library for javascript.
- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - Simple, fast generation of RFC4122 UUIDS.
